# New-Site

Hello there!
I revamped my site to not only showcase my work but to really show my understanding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I DID NOT use Bootstrap to create this but to really sit hard code and learn the key fundamentals of creating a website without a framework.  Furthermore, I had struggles of implementing the portfolio boxes to work in mobile and desktop. Lastly, the pictures that are on the site is mine and I have enjoyed Photoshopping my photos ÔÅä and I used Visual Code as my main text editor. 
Thank you so much for reading and if you want to clone or download that would be nice. (I added comments in my code so you know what to edit.)
